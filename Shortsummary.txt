Final Project - Feride Belma Bumin

In this project, data is taken from the below website;

https://www.kaggle.com/neisse/scrapped-lyrics-from-6-genres/notebooks

- In STATA folder, tools used for the analysis are located  inside folder.
Code folder includes the  do files.Outputs that are derived from the do files
 are put inside the output folder. Also, data folder contains two folder
 inside; one for raw data and one for derived data which is created by using
 do files.

-In Python folder, there is only one jupyter notebook which includes the 
requested data manipulations.

- As the last thing, I would like to add that due to datasets I could not 
figure out how to do reshape the data in STATA. Therefore, I applied only
 merge.
